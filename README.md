## 🔧 Key Components

### Freighter.js
Handles all blockchain interactions and transaction logic:
- `checkConnection()` — Verify Freighter extension is installed
- `retrievePublicKey()` — Get user's Stellar public key
- `getBalance()` — Fetch XLM balance from Horizon
- `fundWallet()` — Fund account via Stellar Friendbot
- `validateTransactionInputs()` — Validate recipient address & amount
- `sendPayment()` — Full transaction flow: build → sign → reconstruct XDR → submit

### useStellarTransaction.js (Hook)
Reusable React hook wrapping the transaction lifecycle:
- Granular status tracking: `idle` → `validating` → `signing` → `submitting` → `success`
- Returns `{ execute, loading, error, txHash, status, reset }`
- Drives the step progress bar UI in the Send XLM card

---

## 🌐 Network

This application runs on the **Stellar Test Network (Testnet)**.

- **Horizon API**: `https://horizon-testnet.stellar.org`
- **Network Passphrase**: `Test SDF Network ; September 2015`

⚠️ **Note**: No real XLM is used. For testnet lumens, visit the [Stellar Testnet Friendbot](https://laboratory.stellar.org/?network=test#friendbot)

---

## 🔐 Security

- **Private Keys**: Never stored or transmitted - Freighter handles signing
- **Network**: Uses HTTPS for all API calls
- **Testnet Only**: Safe for development and testing
- **No Backend**: All transactions happen directly on-chain

---

## 🎨 UI Features

- **Glassmorphic Cards**: Frosted glass effect with backdrop blur
- **Grid Background**: Subtle grid pattern for depth
- **Step Progress Bar**: Visual Validate → Sign → Submit flow
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile
- **Dark Navy Theme**: Premium dark UI with indigo accent system
- **Micro-animations**: Slide-up toasts, shimmer effects, pulse dots
- **SVG Icon System**: Hand-crafted inline SVG icons throughout
- **Copy to Clipboard**: One-click address copy with checkmark feedback
- **Loading Spinners**: Context-aware spinners on all async operations
- **Error/Success Toasts**: Color-coded status messages with icons

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Failed to connect wallet"
- Ensure Freighter extension is installed and active
- Check that you're on a supported browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
- Make sure Freighter is unlocked
- Try refreshing the page

### "Invalid Stellar address"
- Verify the recipient address starts with "G"
- Make sure the address is exactly 56 characters
- Ensure it passes `StrKey.isValidEd25519PublicKey()` validation

### "Insufficient balance"
- Remember the minimum balance reserve (~1 XLM)
- Use "Fund via Friendbot" to get free testnet XLM

### "Transaction timed out"
- The Stellar network may be congested — try again
- Transactions have a 180-second timeout window

### "Unknown response format from Freighter"
- Update your Freighter extension to the latest version
- The app handles multiple Freighter API response formats automatically
